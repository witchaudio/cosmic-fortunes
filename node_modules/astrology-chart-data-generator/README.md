# ChartGenerator

This is an astrology chart generator, employing proportional house formats to astrology charts, and aiming to support the major house systems typically employed by astrologers.

##  Description

The implementation of the ephemeris information is based on Steve Moshier(http://www.moshier.net). 

The ephemeris information was originally transpiled into Javascript by mivion (https://github.com/mivion/ephemeris). 

This project uses 0xStarcat's version of the ephemeris which employs ES6 modules (https://github.com/0xStarcat/Moshier-Ephemeris-JS).

## Performance
- The ephemeris is extremely fast and performs all of its calculations in under what appears to be 100ms. 
- Moshier's Ephemeris works to an acceptable degree of accuracy from -3000 B.C.E - 3000 C.E.
